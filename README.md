## The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

This is the README file for an Etch-A-Sketch web application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Project Description

This project involved creating a functional Etch-A-Sketch application that allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over squares. The grid can be resized based on user input, and squares darken progressively with each interaction.

### Learning Objectives

By building this project, I focused on:

* **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Grasping core concepts like functions, variables, event listeners and DOM manipulation.
* **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Implementing a function to generate a grid of squares dynamically based on user input.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Utilizing Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout for the squares.
* **User Interaction:** Adding hover effects to change the color of squares and implementing a button to allow users to create a new grid.
